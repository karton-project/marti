# Cities and Their Data

We use data related to different cities. We implemented some city data in our dataset cards, and others in gamification. Yet, we have several interesting city datasets awaits students to explore! Here, we shared the unimplemented interesting datasets and data stories.

**Istanbul - Turkey**

- Istanbul Urban Project http://www.istanbulurbandatabase.com/
Students can use https://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/ to create a visual story of the history around the city.
- https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/01/istanbul-turkey-maps-through-history/512123/ 


**Liverpool - UK**

- Cat Population: https://link.medium.com/NSGMiOVfv4 and https://rachaeldottle.com/cats-per-square-km/
- UK music Charts: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/artist-most-no-1-albums-uk?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day

**NSW - Australia**

In 2020, Australia faced a climate disaster that affects the whole country. Multiple bushfires occurred at the same time.

- https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md
- First, simulate and discuss the bushfires use the https://ncase.me/simulating/model/ simulator.

**Melbourne - Australia**

Cityscapes change with the new construction technologies. One way to use rooftops is building gardens!

**Amazon Forests - Brazil**

Populated cities can make awful decisions to find more space for people. For example, Istanbul is one of them which has lost a big proportion of North Forests with new roads and airport areas. 

- https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Turkey.htm

Find the rank of Istanbul's deforestation among the other cities of Turkey. Then use this tool to find the deforestation ratios in Amazon rainforests.

**Munich - Germany**

Every September, Germans and all people around the world welcome October with a big celebration: Oktoberfest! Munich is the heart of this fest and every year thousands of people come across different continents.

## Bonus Activities

After becoming a successful city data scientist you can spend some time on your passion. You might be interested in music, technology or art and create some projects about these topics.

**Music and Technology**

- https://acousticbrainz.org provides a large dataset of music. 

Some researchers spend some time analyzing mood development through years in the pop genre. Here is the article:
