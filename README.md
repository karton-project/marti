## Designing a Data Programming Language

- We have developed two interfaces for two different cases:
    1. [Web interface with drag and drop programming blocks](index.html)
    2. [Mobile interface with tangible paper blocks](tangible.html) 

The web interface is designed for an easy and fast manipulation of data. You can manipulate data with basic math
 operations, visualize it, gather data from csv files, represent data on geographic maps or use pictures as your data.
 
 You can use your mobile phone with the helper card blocks. The card blocks can be recognized with the camera interface.
